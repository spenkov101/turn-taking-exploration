# Turn-Taking Exploration

Exploratory analysis of turn-taking cues in English and multilingual conversational dialogue.

This repository is a **lightweight, incremental research notebook** with the ambition to turn into a finished system.
The goal is to explore **how turns begin and end in dialogue**, focusing on:

- turn boundaries
- response adjacency
- lexical and structural cues at turn endings

The work here is intentionally exploratory and empirical at the start.

## Scope

- Language: English, Bulgarian, others...
- Modality: Text dialogue (no audio, no prosody markers might be  added manually)
- Approach: Descriptive statistics, simple analyses, and small probes


## Status
Initialized — analysis to be added incrementally.
