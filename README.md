# Turn-Taking Exploration

Exploratory analysis of turn-taking cues in English conversational dialogue.

This repository is a **lightweight, incremental research notebook** rather than a finished system.
The goal is to explore **how turns begin and end in dialogue**, focusing on:

- turn boundaries
- response adjacency
- lexical and structural cues at turn endings

The work here is intentionally exploratory and empirical.
It is designed to support intuition-building and small observations, not to make strong modeling claims.

## Scope

- Language: English
- Modality: Text dialogue (no audio, no prosody in the initial phase)
- Approach: Descriptive statistics, simple analyses, and small probes

## Non-Goals

- Building a production dialogue model
- Claiming human-like conversational intelligence
- Replacing linguistic analysis with end-to-end ML

## Work Style

This repository will evolve through **small daily contributions**:
- one notebook
- one table
- one plot
- one idea at a time

## Status

🚧 Initialized — analysis to be added incrementally.
