# Audio & Prosody (Future Scope)

This project is currently text-only.

Audio and prosodic cues (e.g. pauses, pitch drops, overlaps) are next.

The following signals are of interest for the extension:
- silence duration before turn onset
- pitch reset / pitch drop at turn end
- overlap vs clean handover
- filled pauses (uh, um) preceding speaker switch

Any audio-based work will be added incrementally and kept separate from
text-based turn-taking utilities.
