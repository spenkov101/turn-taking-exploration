# Language Scope and Motivation

The initial focus of this project is English dialogue, due to data availability
and existing benchmarks.

However, a secondary motivation is to explore **whether turn-taking cues transfer
across languages**, particularly to Bulgarian.

Key questions:
- Which turn-boundary signals appear language-specific?
- Which cues (e.g. questions, discourse closure) seem cross-linguistic?
- What breaks when moving from English to Bulgarian dialogue?

Multilingual exploration will remain exploratory and descriptive unless
sufficient evidence supports stronger claims.
