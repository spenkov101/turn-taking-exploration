# Turn-taking exploration — sanity checks

This notebook is used for quick, incremental checks of utilities
and assumptions. It is not meant to contain final analyses.

from src.turn_utils import turn_last_tokens

example_dialogue = [
    "Hi, how are you?",
    "I'm good, thanks! And you",
    "Great, what are you up to?",
    "Just working on a project."
]

turn_last_tokens(example_dialogue)
Expected behavior:
- Questions should end with '?'
- Statements typically end with '.' or a word token
